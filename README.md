# MORE MOVIE METADATA - Client

This is the UI client for MORE MOVIE METADATA. This application will provide you with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres.
You will be able to sign up here and create a list of your favorite movies.

## Technologies

This is crafted with node.js using the folowing packages:

- REACT
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- Axios

## Goal

The goal here was to wireframe, prototype, design (only Bootstrap) and write a fully functional application that is capable of using all endpoints from the More Movie Metadata backend (which I wrote by myself too: https://github.com/hannesdonel/MMM) and display it to the user with a familiar UX feel.
